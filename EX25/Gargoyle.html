                                This month Middle Age Arts introduces the Gargoyle Collection.
                                I'm really excited about this new set of classical figures.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The collection contains faithful reproductions of gargoyles
                                from some of the famous cathedrals of Europe, including Notre
                                Dame, Rheims and Warwick Castle. All reproductions are done to
                                exacting and loving detail.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The collection also contains original works by noted artists
                                such as Susan Bedford and Antonio Salvari. Our expert artisans
                                have produced some wonderful and whimsical works, perfectly
                                suited for home or garden use.

                                This month's artist is Michael Cassini. Michael has been a
                                professional sculptor for ten years. He has won numerous
                                awards, including the prestigious Reichsman Cup and an Award
                                of Merit at the 1997 Tuscany Arts Competition.

                                Michael specializes in recreations of gargoyles from European
                                cathedrals. You'll usually find Michael staring intently at
                                the church walls in northern France. His work is represented
                                by the Turin Gargoyle, a great entry to our Gargoyle
                                Collection.
