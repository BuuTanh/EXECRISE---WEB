                    Welcome to the Dunston Retreat Center. Whether you are planning to
                    attend one of our many conferences or embarking on a private
                    retreat, we're sure that you will enjoy your stay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Located in the northern woods of Wisconsin, the Dunston Retreat
                    Center provides comfortable and attractive accommodations while you
                    enjoy the rustic setting available just outside your door. The
                    Retreat Center has 32 beds, large meeting rooms, a chapel, and
                    kitchen facilities. If you want to get out, there are ample
                    opportunities for hiking, canoeing and horseback riding in the
                    surrounding area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout the year the center staff conducts retreats to
                    accommodate the needs of various groups. We offer retreats for men,
                    for women, and for couples. Please call about special needs
                    retreats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you prefer, an individually directed retreat is possible. The
                    retreat includes a time of daily sharing and guidance by a retreat
                    director to supplement your private time of solitude and meditation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the Dunston Retreat Center we make everything as easy as
                    possible, providing meals, towels, bedding - everything you need.
                    Just bring yourself.
                </p>

                <h2>A letter from one of our guests</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm writing to tell you how much I enjoyed my retreat at Dunston. I
                    came to your center haggard and worn out from a long illness and job
                    difficulties. I left totally refreshed. I especially want to thank
                    Father Thomas Holloway for his support.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've enthusiastically told all of my friends about the wonderful
                    place you have. Some of us are hoping to organize a group retreat.
                    Rest assured that you'll see me again. Going to Dunston will become
                    a yearly event for me.
                </p>
                <p>Sincerely,</p>
